### Loading the extension

* First clone or download the repo and extract (if downloaded as zip)
* Go to chrome://extensions
* Enable the Developer mode
* Click load unpacked extension
* Select the cloned or extracted directory (which directly contains manifest.json file inside)
* Thats all ! Now whenever you open Github Repository page, this should be doing its job.

### If you want to add your language

Its super-easy to add other language resource. Just head over to js/resources.js and add link to an image.
